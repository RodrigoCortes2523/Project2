        <p class="aboutPar">
          I have been playing MMORPG'S since about 2001. The first game I played
          was called Everquest. Ever since then I have been playing most of
          these type of games. I think that these types of games are different
          than other games in that these types of games offer a sense of
          community where players can play together and interact. Before social
          media became a big thing these games offered a method for like minded
          people to interact with each other while simultaneously exploring a
          large world. With social media being so large today, MMORPG's have
          lost a lot of interest. A large portion of the playerbase in these
          games tend to be older. I am one of those players.
